# 🏏 IPL 2024 - Query-Based Cricket Analysis (MySQL Project)

This project focuses on analyzing IPL 2024 match data using MySQL. It covers the complete process from raw CSV datasets to meaningful query-based insights, allowing a deeper understanding of database systems and SQL querying techniques.

## 📁 Project Overview

The project consists of:

- Match-level and ball-by-ball data from IPL 2024
- Cleaned and structured CSV files
- SQL scripts to create tables and load data
- A set of analytical SQL queries to extract insights
- Screenshots or outputs of selected query results

## 🎯 Objectives

- Practice MySQL commands and queries
- Perform real-world dataset handling using SQL
- Explore match statistics and player performance using database queries
- Understand the structure and workflow of a query-based DBMS project

## 📦 Dataset Details

- `ipl_2024_matches.csv`: Contains match-wise information (teams, scores, venue, winner, etc.)
- `ipl_2024_deliveries.csv`: Ball-by-ball delivery data (bowler, batsman, runs, extras, wickets, etc.)

## 🔧 Workflow Summary

1. Cleaned the original dataset for compatibility with MySQL.
2. Created SQL tables matching the data schema.
3. Loaded the data into MySQL using `LOAD DATA INFILE`.
4. Executed SQL queries to answer interesting cricket-related questions.
5. Saved outputs and organized the project into folders.

## 📂 Folder Structure

- `data/` → Final CSV files for import  
- `queries/` → All SQL queries used  
- `schema/` → SQL table creation scripts    

## ✅ Outcomes

- Developed skills in database creation, data import, and SQL querying
- Gained practical experience in handling real datasets
- Understood how to structure and present a MySQL mini-project
